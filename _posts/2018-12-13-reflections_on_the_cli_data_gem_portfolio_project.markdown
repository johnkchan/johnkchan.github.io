I have always found the best way to learn and expand upon new concepts/ ideas is to tinker on projects that you find interesting. With this mindset, I try to explore ways to apply my technical learnings to my personal life and hobbies. One hobby that has recently taken off for me is board games. Over the last couple of years, I have researched new games to play and expand my personal collection with. While researching for new games, I would often search for information related to the game's genre, community ranking, player count, market price, etc. During this process, I often thought to myself that I could potentially leverage technology to streamline this endeavor and consolidate information more quickly. As such, I figured the CLI Data GEM Portfolio Project was the perfect opportunity for me to do so. I approached the project by first finding a reliable website that I could quickly pull the key details of a board game from. After settling on a website to scrap, I would have to determine what were the key datapoints that I was looking for. I had to reflect on what information I would want to see quickly. After consolidating a list of key datapoints, it was time to inspect the website and determine what elements could I map my project to.

I have always believed that the best way to learn and internalize any new concepts/ ideas is to tinker on projects that you find interesting. As such, I often try to explore new ways to apply any new technical learnings to my personal life such as hobbies. One hobby that has recently taken off for me is board games. With the board game industry expanding over the last couple of years, players now have a wealth of games and genres to pick from. Whenever I am considering expanding my personal collection of board games, I often research potential games and search for information such as expansions, community ranking, player count, market price, etc. During this process, I often consider how technology could be leveraged to streamline and consolidate these key data points more efficiently. With this in mind, I decided the CLI Data GEM Portfolio Project would be the perfect opportunity for this endeavor.

My approach to the project was to first find a reliable website that I could quickly pull the key details of a board game from. After settling on a website to scrap, I would have to determine what were the key data points that I was looking for. I had to reflect on what information I would want to see quickly. After consolidating a list of key data points, it was time to inspect the website and determine what elements could I map my project to.

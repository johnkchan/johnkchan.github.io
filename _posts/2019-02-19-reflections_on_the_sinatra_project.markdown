The Sinatra Project was the first project I worked on which utilizes the MVC design. It was a good opportunity to solidify what I had been learning for the past month and to really create the backbone of a modern day website. As always, I emphasize that the best way to learn and internalize a new concept is to utilize it on a topic/ idea that held great interest or value to me. I decided to revisit my boardgame idea originally from my CLI Data GEM Project but to add more flavor and personality into it. My goal was to create a functioning website in which users can create boardgames and add said boardgame to their collection under their profile. With this idea, I set up the respective Model, View, and Controller files for the boardgame and users. Thanks to the magic behind Sinatra, I was able to connect the boardgame class to the user class. This allowed me to use Sinatra's built in class methods to access a users boardgame with ease.


One takeaway from working midway on the project was that I would have saved more time and effort if I had originally structured and organized what I had wanted to do. As a positive note from this experience, by approaching the Sinata project with this unorganized and unstructured manner, I was able to drill several concepts by tediously doing it the hard way.

Hi, my name is Jon Chan. 

At the time of writing this post, I have completed 3 years of working in the Financial Services industry. 

Not long ago, I graduated with a Bachelor's Degree in Economics and was fortunate enough to be offered a full time position with a company I admired. Although I have transitioned into a different firm since, one thing has remained the same throughout my career. That one thing was the long hours of repetitive manual work.

I gravitate towards tinkering with new ways to approach my business commitments and daily responsibilities. I started off by familiarizing myself with Visual Basics for Applications (VBA) and implementing it into my daily job to experiment with process automation and data analysis. What started out as one language, quickly progressed into several subsequent languages like Python and Structured Query Language (SQL). I soon found myself enamored with the breadth of the programming world and the limitless possibilities for further study. Working with a system oriented mindset, building macros, and finding innovative ways to streamline all operations and building solutions was the biggest satisfaction from teaching myself these languages. I quickly realized that my passion resides in programming and computer science.
